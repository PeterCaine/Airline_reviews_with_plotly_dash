# Airline_reviews_with_plotly_dash
A project demonstrating a range of nlp approaches on consumer reviews visualised using plotly dash.

A working version can be found <a href="http://64.225.67.155:8050/" target="_blank">here</a>

Techniques include - collocation/phrase analysis; LDA topic modelling; regex chunking; and a variety of filtering techniques. 

Word embeddings were used to perform a synonym suggest tool, but it proved to be very slow in deployment and was depracated.
